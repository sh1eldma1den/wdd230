                <p><em>(WRDW) By Nick Proto </em><br><br>
                    Aiken city officials are committed to growth in the area, and local 
                    business owners are excited for what that means for their businesses.<br><br>
                    "I'm pumped," said Alley Kneece, owner of Alley Downtown Taproom. "I think the more the merrier." 
                    Kneece opened the Alley Downtown Taproom in March 2017. "It was very quiet. There wasn't a lot of 
                    traffic," she said. "There wasn't a buzz around the town about downtown Aiken." <br> <br>
                    But a lot has changed since then, and a lot more change is on the way.<br> <br>
                    "Having growth is very good," said Van Smith, owner of Lionel Smith Limited. "If you're standing 
                    still, you're going backwards." Smith was born and raised in Aiken, and took over the family 
                    business in 1992. He's also on the board for the Aiken Downtown Development Association. While 
                    some people may not want change, he said the city needs it.<br><br>
                    "I think that you have a healthy city with some change," he said. "You want to keep the people 
                    you have, but you definitely want some change."<br><br>
                    More people means more businesses coming downtown. Instead of seeing competition, Kneece sees 
                    a partnership.<br><br>
                    "If there was only just me downtown, then no one would come downtown," she said. "Most people 
                    don't go to the same spot every single day. You need more."
