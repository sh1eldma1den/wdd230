                Aiken’s residents have the best of both worlds—they can enjoy big city life without having to live

​                For those who enjoy history and culture, Aiken sits in the middle of the South Carolina National Heritage 
                Corridor—one of several corridors in the United States. The corridor was designed to encourage 
                people to get off the interstates and onto the back roads of South Carolina, where they
                can learn about the state’s traditions and culture ​and experience various festivals and foods.

                <p>Aiken was chartered in 1835 as the terminus of the railroad built between Hamburg, South Carolina, and Charleston,
                    South Carolina. This railroad was constructed to transport goods, mostly cotton. The railroad and cotton fields were
                    not all that grew in this small town. Aiken soon established itself as a fine equestrian community, with 
                    numerous dedicated jump and polo fields. Aiken attracted many visitors, particularly wealthy 
                    Charlestonians who spent their summers at the "place of retreat from the heat and malaria of unhealthier regions."<br><br><br>

                <p> After the conclusion of the Civil War, Aiken began to attract wealthy Northerners, who were lured to the area by 
                    the opportunities for equestrian sports, thus establishing Aiken’s celebrated “Winter Colony.” Among those who wintered 
                    here was Thomas Hitchcock, who with the Whitney’s established the tract of land known as Hitchcock Woods for public use. 
                    The restorations experienced in houses and churches reflect the wealth and sophistication of the population during the 
                    Winter Colony era and illustrate its impact on the community. Hayne Avenue, Colleton Avenue, South Boundary and Whiskey 
                    Road are old, fashionable residential avenues which attracted both local residents and winter visitors to build beautiful homes. 
                    Historic downtown Aiken continues to serve as a vibrant business hub for the community and provides a unique identity and charm 
                    for the area.<br><br><br>

                    Powered by the constant influx of scientists and engineers drawn to the Department of Energy site, Aiken forges onward,
                    relishing the charm and heritage of the past and teeming with the anticipation of a rich cultural future.<br><br><br>
