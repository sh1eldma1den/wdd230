        <h2>Projected Site Users</h2>
        <p>It is expected that the primary users of this site will be local residents, from teenagers
            looking to find the local weather before a game, to retirement-aged users looking to check the 
            weather before recreational events. Adult residents will use this site to check the weather, but also
            to find out information on weather-related events and news, and local contests.
        </p>
        <h3>User 1</h3>
        <p>Cameron is a 14 year old freshman in high school. He likes hanging out with his friends, eating Pringles
            by the metric tonne. He plays video games and is an average student. He navigates the web very well primarily on
            his smartphone, but also on his school chromebook. </p>
        <h3>Scenario 1</h3>
        <p>Cameron is tasked with keeping a record of weather conditions in his area as a high school project and 
            was directed to this website by his teacher as a resource. He navigates to the website using his smartphone
            and selects his city, Soda Springs, from the nav bar. He easily sees the current weather, notes it for his class,
            then becomes distracted by a banner on the site announcing a weather exhibition at Idaho State University and clicks
            on that for more information, wondering if that might be something he could use for his project.
        </p>
        <h3>User 2</h3>
        <p>Angela is a 50 year old bank teller. She thinks every day about retirement, but enjoys her job and coworkers. 
            She has just started getting grandchildren and looks forward to spending time with them. She's concerned that 
            young people spend too much time indoors, which is such a shame when living in a place like Southeastern Idaho.
        </p>
        <h3>Scenario 2</h3>
        <p>Angela navigates to the website on her work computer. She clicks on her city, which is Preston. She is looking for the 
            chances of snow over the weekend, as she wants to try to persuade her daughter to take her two grandchildren for a short 
            hike. She looks up the weather for the entire weekend, then for the next weekend, just in case they have something planned
            for the weekend. She also checks to see if there are any interesting events going on, just in case there is snow. She then
            searches out the latest weather photo contest, thinking if there will be clouds this weekend there may be an interesting
            sunset.
